# Introduction

## Purpose of the App
The primary objective of this application is to streamline the process of managing office space calendars for subletting. 
It aims to provide a user-friendly platform where subletters (those renting the office space) can effortlessly create and 
manage appointments on the office calendar. This system is designed to bring efficiency and organization to the process of
office subletting, ensuring that both the office owners and subletters can maximize the usage of the available office space.

## Target Users
- **Office Owners/Landlords:** Individuals or entities who own office spaces and wish to sublet them. They will use the app 
to monitor bookings, manage available dates, and oversee the usage of their property.
- **Subletters:** Professionals or organizations looking to rent office space for short-term or flexible periods. They require
an intuitive system to book office space according to their scheduling needs.

## Key Objectives
- To provide a centralized, easy-to-navigate calendar interface for booking office spaces.
- To facilitate effective communication and scheduling between office owners and subletters.
- To ensure a seamless booking experience, minimizing conflicts and double-bookings.
- To offer a scalable solution that can cater to multiple office spaces and varying subletting needs.
